## Basic Banking System
This is a basic banking website developed as part of my internship with The Sparks Foundation. The objective of this project is to create a simple dynamic website that simulates a banking system.

## Task-1: Basic Banking System
The task involved creating a website with the following specifications:

- Start by creating dummy data for up to 10 customers in the database. The database options can include MySQL, MongoDB, Postgres, or any other suitable database. The customers table should contain basic fields such as name, email, and current balance. The transfers table will record all transfer transactions.

- The flow of the website should be as follows:

- Home Page
    * View all Customers
    * Select and View a specific Customer
    * Transfer Money between Customers
    * Select the recipient Customer for the transfer
    * View all Customers
- The website does not require a login page or user creation. It focuses solely on transferring money between multiple users.

- The website can be hosted on platforms such as 000webhost, GitHub Pages, Heroku, or any other free hosting provider. The code should be stored in a Git repository.

Please note that this project aims to demonstrate the basic functionalities of a banking system.
